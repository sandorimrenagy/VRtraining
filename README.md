Musical Performance Anxiety VRTraining Study at the University of Pécs, Faculty of Music and Visual Arts, Institute of Music, Pécs

Musical Performance Anxiety (MPA) is a serious challenge for many music performance students and professionals as well. 
One popular treatment for some types of anxiety and phobias is exposure therapy, which gradually increases the level of "threat" to the patients 
making them habituate to it. It works most effectively accompanied by cognitive behavior therapies (CBT). One modern approach of exposure therapy is virtual reality, 
where fear-evoking situation is provided by virtual environments.

In our study we created a virtual concert hall, with a musical perfomance exam situation, where students saw their own teachers sitting by the jury table.
We used a Meta Quest 3 VR headset for the virtual reality. Participants practiced two times a week, three weeks before their exams. Experimental group members saw 
the virtual exam situation during these practice session, while control group members used the headset's pass-thorugh cameras to see thair actual environment. 
We measured their heart rate and breathing rate with Hexoskin smartshirts (https://hexoskin.com/) 3 times: a 5 minute resting state, a baseline session, 
where they played the exam pieces and finally during the exam performance. 

The raw ECG and respiration signals were downloaded from Hexoskin's dasboard. This repo is for sharing data and the analysis codes. The data creation, manipulation, signal processing 
and tryouts/tests are mostly for presentation. The actual analyses are the data_analysis.ipynb and Vrtraining_with_pymer4.ipynb files.
